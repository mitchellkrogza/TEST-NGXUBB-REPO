# /etc/fail2ban/filter.d/nginxrepeatoffender.conf
# Fail2Ban Blacklist for Repeat Offenders of Nginx (filter.d)
#
# Author: Mitchell Krog <mitchellkrog@gmail.com>
# Version: 1.1
#
# Add on for Nginx Ultimate Bad Bot blocker
# GitHub: https://github.com/mitchellkrogza/nginx-ultimate-bad-bot-blocker
#
# Tested On: Fail2Ban 0.9.3
# Server: Ubuntu 16.04
# Firewall: IPTables
#
# Dependancies: requires nginxrepeatoffender.conf in /etc/fail2ban/action.d folder
#               requires jail settings called [nginxrepeatoffender]
#				requires nginx.repeatoffender file in /etc/fail2ban
#				create with sudo touch /etc/fail2ban/nginx.repeatoffender
#				chmod +x /etc/fail2ban/nginx.repeatoffender
#
# Drawbacks: Only works with IPTables
#
# Based on: The Recidive Jail from Fail2Ban
#			This custom filter and action will monitor your Nginx logs and perma-ban
#			any IP address that has generated far too many 444 or 403 errors over a 1 week period
#			and ban them for 1 day. This works like a charm as an add-on for my Nginx Bad
#			Bot Blocker which takes care of generating the 444 or 403 errors based on the extensive
#			list of Bad Referers, Bots, Scrapers and IP addresses it covers.
#			See - https://github.com/mitchellkrogza/nginx-ultimate-bad-bot-blocker for more info
#
# This custom action requires a custom jail in your 
# jail.local file for Fail2Ban
# 
# Your jail file would be configured as follows
#
# [nginxrepeatoffender]
# enabled = true
# logpath = %(nginx_access_log)s
# filter = nginxrepeatoffender
# banaction = nginxrepeatoffender
# bantime  = 86400   ; 1 day
# findtime = 604800   ; 1 week
# maxretry = 20
